    "You will dream of a blue staircase, and two days later you’ll see it — but not where you expect.",
    "A receipt from 2017 will reveal a secret you didn’t know you were keeping.",
    "You will recognise someone by the sound of their breathing, not their face.",
    "You will eat something familiar that tastes faintly of nostalgia and metal.",
